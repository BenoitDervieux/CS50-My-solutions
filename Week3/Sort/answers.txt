sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: The time difference between the random and the sorted list is n to n^2 different. The algorithm also performs best for the sorted list.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: The algorithm is the most performing. It also varies only depending on the number of values, not really on the fact that it is sorted, random or reversed.
